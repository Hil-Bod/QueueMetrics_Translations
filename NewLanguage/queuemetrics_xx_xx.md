# Translation file for QueueMetrics - a dummy one

THis is an example language pack for a new language:

- Find the correct locale, e.g. https://www.localeplanet.com/java/am-ET/index.html
- copy this to the main level
- Edit `Aitrans` and add an entry like:  `[language: "am_ET", full_name: "Ahmaric (Ethiopia)", included: false],`
- Run `Aitrans.rewrite_languages()`
