# QueueMetrics translations

This repository contains translation files for Loway QueueMetrics. Here you can help 
create, complete and fix translations.
In order to participate, you need a GitHub account.

## How it works.

If you need to create a translation for a **new language**, meaning one of the languages that are not yet included here, 
you need to open a GithHub Issue and let an admin create an empty language for you.

Once the language is created, it can contain three kinds of localizations:

‚Äì A _translated entry_, meaning a translation that has been written or at least reviewed 
 by a translator. It will appear as it is in QueueMetrics.
‚Äì An üëΩ  _alien translation_  , meaning that it was either created automatically through an AI, 
  or imported from a similar language (for example, if there is no entry for an item for Spanish, but 
  there is one for Latin-American Spanish, we display the latter because it‚Äôs likely to be kind of right). 
  Those translation appear as they are in QueueMetrics.
‚Äì A üî¥ _missing translation_. This is an item that exists in the English language, but nobody yet translated it 
  to your language. In QueueMetrics, it appears using the English localization.

When you work on a translation for a specific language, your goal is to  **review alien translations** and, 
more importantly, **complete missing translations**. If you look at a language file, you will see that we 
added an icon ‚û°Ô∏è before each translation that you have to complete and an icon üëΩ or üî¥ for each item to be completed, 
so that it is easy to quickly scan the file and  and find the ones that need completing.

The document structure of the language is instead taken verbatim from English, 
and you should not modify it. Even if you were to change it, it would be put back to the format used by English. 
The structure and comments have no function in the translation but clarifying what is what.

There is also an index file that display the status of completion for different languages.

## In practice

### How do I add a missing translation?

First you go look for entries that are preceded by a comment line with a red dot. 
There, you can see the value of that label for the English language.

The only thing you need to do is to add your translation in the white space that follows the label.
If you want to, you can remove the comment and remove the arrow, but it‚Äôs not needed.

### How do I confirm that  an alien translation is correct, or change it?

You can find Alun translations by looking for the Alun icon in the comment line. As it is the case for missing the translations, before each of those lines there is a comment that shows the current value for English.




If you want to confirm, the translation is right, or to edit it, you simply remove the? After the =.

How do I do this in practice?

As this is, this is GitHub, the way to do a complete translation is first for king of the project,then making your changes, then sending us a polo request.

Do I need to do it even if I only have a couple of changes, or want to correct the typo?

Blah blah blah
